As March comes to a close (it is now the second day of April) I need to update you on the happenings of [12 Months, 12 Things](https://blog.jden.me/12-months-12-things/)—which I keep calling *12 Things, 12 Months*. March has been an impossibly busy time for me; juggling the opening of a new show, finishing the run of another show, travelling 600 km for a one-off show, to writing a screenplay and working almost every other day. As a result it is now April and I still have lots to write about my Fringe experience and still have much of a screenplay to write all the while I should be starting a new project—and I am.

Throughout April there will be three streams of posts on this blog—I am telling this to the whole one-and-half persons who read this blog (not including myself). 

1. Finishing off posts from [January/February](https://blog.jden.me/the-tale-of-two-fringes/) Projects a.k.a. Adelaide Fringe shows.
2. Updates on the [screenplay](https://blog.jden.me/march-writing-a-screenplay/) and completing and submission into competitions—with helpful hard deadlines. 
3. The new about-to-be announced April project.

So that is the March of progress for this little project I am working on. Hopefully by the end of April this streams will be forming a nice big lake.
