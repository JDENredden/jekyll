Now I am a techie and Apple fanboy. But I dont find the iPad useful at all. Except for maybe browsing a little web and RSS feeds in the morning. And games.

But as a work device it sucks.

As a school text book it sucks.

As a creation device it sucks.

As a gaming device it is mildly successful.

It dosent make much sense to me tbh.
