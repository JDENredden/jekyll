**Magna Carta… Jden Grail**

I did a thing. I thought it would be cool to act like _Jay Z_, so I made my own _Magna Carta… Holy Grail_ album art. The hardest thing was finding the raw photo of the statues without _Jay Z_’s name on it. I found out that&nbsp;_Ari Marcopoulos_ took the photo for _Jay Z_, and found an original photo. Was still pretty hard, I haven’t nailed down the font 100%. I went for _News Gothic Bold_, originally I thought _Franklin Gothic_ as someone posted online, but _News Gothic_ fit best, except for the terminal on the J, which ends at a different angle. But it was the best font I could find that I owned. I attached a progress snap too.
