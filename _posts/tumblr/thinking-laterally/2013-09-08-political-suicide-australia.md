**Political Suicide**

> _Australia has&nbsp;committed&nbsp;political suicide.&nbsp;_

My response to the results of last nights Australian Federal Election where Tony Abbott has become Prime Minister. Got a new set of coloured notepads today and it made me think of [Brock Davis](http://www.designboom.com/)â€™ [notepad piece](http://www.designboom.com/cms/images/ridhika/brock3.jpg)&nbsp;and it gave me idea to incorporate a real life 3D element to a flat 2D piece of paper. So in the hour I had left before I left to work I whipped up ballot form and took some photos with a yoyo string noose. &nbsp;
