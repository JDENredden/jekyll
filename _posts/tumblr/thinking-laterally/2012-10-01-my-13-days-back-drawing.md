**My 13 Days Back Drawing**

> 13 days ago, procrastinating from doing homework, I started to doodle my hand. And for the first time since year 4/5, I started to draw again. Bar you know Mr McCleans great insight into critiquing&nbsp;practitioners&nbsp;work in year 8/9 art. This was my first endeavour into the drawing since I was drawing YuGiOh in year 5. Its fun. I’ve grown found of the biro. It’s more raw and rough and requires more work than a pencil. If you make a mistake, well tough shit, you gotta deal with. You gotta make it work even if it means changing the entire perspective of your drawing. Should quit now while I’m still&nbsp;infatuated&nbsp;by the idea. Before I begin to hate it again for another 8 years.
