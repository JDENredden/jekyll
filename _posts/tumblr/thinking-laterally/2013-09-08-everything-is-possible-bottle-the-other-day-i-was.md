**Everything Is Possible Bottle**

The other day I was in an Australian store called Typo and they have these really pretty and cool looking bottles there, and I’ve always admired them and wanted to do something cool with them. So this visit I bought one and came home and wrote a post saying I am going to do something cool with this. 10 minutes later I have a Tic-Tac container impossibly inside. This is idea is based off the [Anything is Possible Bottle](http://blog.sendwonder.com/p/store.html) by [Jamie Grant](http://sendwonder.com/). Originally I wanted to put a mini deck of cards in my bottle but I couldn’t find one. So I looked for the next best thing. I’ve always admired Jamie’s bottles and still don’t know how he does it. Bottles like this are fantastic to inspire people. Everyone I have shown mine to love it.
