I am the things of my past.&nbsp;

> Kinetic typography animation of a poem that I had to write for English. May be a little overkill for what they asked for.  
>   
> 20 hours of animation with Flash CS5. First ever kinetic typography, it shows, not perfect but learnt allot from it.
> 
> Teachers thought this was the best thing since sliced bread, showed it to all their classes. I didnâ€™t think it was that great.

> Music: Flutterby by Philter
