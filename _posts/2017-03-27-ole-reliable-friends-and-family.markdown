One thing that I learnt this year more than anything was that you can never trust someone when they say

> "yeah, I'll come see your show".

It's no doubt well meaning and they have all the intention of coming to your show, however soon enough the end of the season rolls by and they still haven't bought a ticket.

I hope this post does not sound bitter, but it is a little disheartening when the people you think would be there for you in a heartbeat aren't there to support you. My immediate family came to my shows but my extended family—which are not as estranged as this post makes it look like—were few and far between. The hundred-and-something strong cohort of fellow employees resulted in a handful of ticket sales. Once again, this is not a "woe is me" self-depricating post, by all metrics they were excited to see the show and had been asking me about it months before hand.

The main issue that I found was that there was too much choice for days to go, having a show—in some cases more than one—a day meant that my show fell into the background noise. There was no time pressure or window in which they needed to come. They could come everyday, which in the end they meant they came no day.

For the most part I pushed this aside and didn't dwell too much on it—its the stuff of diary confessionals—instead I made sure those who came saw a good show, and gave the others a serious case of FOMO.
