This month I will do something I have been talking about for a long time. I am going to start a podcast. 

It will be called *Multi-disciplinary*, an infrequent conversation about diverse and numerous creative fields.

The idea will be that I will talk to and interview—slash—hangout with creatives from different fields — hence multi-disciplinary. 

Let's go.
