This past month has probably been the least productive month of my adult life. A large part of this is my failure to complete this month's *thing*. I call it laziness but someone with a degree in psychiatry might want to claim it's something else. I blame it on my appalling diet of this month, I've eaten more processed foods and transfats to last me a decade. 

The good news I guess, is the project of this month Poppigami doesn't have a *hard* due date until October of this year, so never fret it will be finishedâ€”just not now. Also, turns out the legality of creating a non-for-profit is much harder than one might expect. 

Among the other things I should have done at sometime this month was to sort out my enrolment for University to finish off two degrees, a *Splash Adelaide* event, personal website, and national Fringe tour registration. Not a great time to be unmotivated. 

We must continue and tomorrow I will announce the next month on the every continuing list of projects that get 90% complete. See you then.
