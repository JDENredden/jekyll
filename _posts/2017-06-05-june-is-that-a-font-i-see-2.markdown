This month I will do something I have wanted to do for a very long time. I will be designing my own glasses, as in spectacles for the face — but they will be modelled on fonts (or typefaces if you want to be fancy).

There has already been at least one of these glasses been designed before, but there are a number of issues with them — that I will go through another time — nonetheless I am excited. 

The plan is to 3D print them at some stage and stealth send them to [Bailey Nelson](http://www.baileynelson.com) (or anyone else that makes eyewear) and get them instores and make a bunch of money and live happily ever after.

Let's go.
