For another year Adelaide Fringe is finished. This year was very much a learning experience the first time doing solo shows and the first time producing more than one show. In the end I sold over a 1000 tickets and performed 1.3333 shows a day, everyday for 30 days for 40 shows in total.

It was a really busy month and I'm incredibly tired as a result, which also meant I didn't get to write as many posts as I would have liked to. I have a lists of posts to write in OmniFocus and will work through them and post a bunch all at once soon. 

This short posts serves as a stick in the ground saying that I'm finished and you will hear from me soon.
