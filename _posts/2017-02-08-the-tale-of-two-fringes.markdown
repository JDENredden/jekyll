For the months of January and February in the [12 Months, 12 Things](https://blog.jden.me/12-months-12-things/) project I am producing two shows for the [Adelaide Fringe Festival](www.adelaidefringe.com). This will be the cononical post for these two months I will update this with further blog posts and other bits of information. 

The two shows are [*SUPERHUMAN*](www.FascinatingLies.com/SUPERHUMAN) at The Bally — Gluttony and [*The Expert at the Card Table — How to Cheat at Cards*](www.FascinatingLies.com/Cheat) at The Tuxedo Cat. And the required promotional copy is provided below. 

#### SUPERHUMAN

> Not all heroes wear capes — some read minds.

> Do you believe in superpowers? After mind-boggling 2016 Fringe audiences with his sell-out debut show *Reading Minds and Other Fascinating Lies*, jden redden is back to wow you with his superhuman abilities. Think telekinesis, psychokinesis, mind-reading and superhuman strength.

> Myths and stories of such powers attributed throughout the Cold War with both the Soviets and U.S. discovering and nurturing superhuman ability to gain the edge.

> *SUPERHUMAN* demonstrates these abilities live on stage in a new, modern setting with lots of audience participation to create a night of wonderful and unique miracles.

> Don’t forget to bring your smartphones—Snapchat a picture with the *SUPERHUMAN* geofilter and be apart of the show that will leave you scratching your head and pondering the world, as you know it.

> Open your eyes—because not everything is as it seems.

> Armed with only 52 playing cards, two hands and 60 minutes, jden redden—the expert at cards—is back from his sell-out debut, 2016 Fringe show, *Reading Minds and Other Fascinating Lies*.

> This new production uncovers the secrets and dirty work of the gaming elite, demonstrating world-class card manipulation and deceit at the card table.

> The show shadows the logical conclusions and plays-out the physical interpretations of the book *The Expert at the Card Table*. A cult-like bible of the Magical and Gambling world published in 1902 by an equally mysterious man known as S. W. Erdnase.

> This crash course in card cheating will leave you dazzled—opening your mind to another world full of exotic card flourishes, cardistry and cunning deceit.

> You'll never play a game of Poker the same again.
