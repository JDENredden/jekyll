I've been slowly putting together my own Contax Zeiss cine prime set, and found myself making crazy Excel Spreadsheets as I try to piece together a nice set of primes from the Contax Zeiss range. In this post, I'll show you all my working and show you how to build your own set of Contax Zeiss glass, and show you some sets that other people have put together.

## Why Contax Carl Zeiss?

During the mid-1970s, Carl Zeiss of West Germany partnered with Yashica in Japan to launch a new line of Contax SLR cameras. Together, the two companies created the Contax/Yashica (C/Y) mount. The partnership of the two companies produced a set of extremely high quality lenses built from Carl Zeiss designs. The lens were manufactured in both Germany and Japan, and with two different aperture varieties. 

The lenses have remained popular with collectors and film makers alike for the close resemblance to Carl Zeiss Super Speeds cinema prime lenses. The lenses carry a similar design, build quality, and aesthetic with the the Super Speeds that can go for several-to-tens-of-thousands-of-dollars per lens. Comparatively, Contax Zeiss lenses can be had for hundreds to low thousands. 

To learn more about these lenses [Media Division](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPf67c3vUrFlNOERwjHyR2w) has an amazing [46-minute long video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUjUxKvXgpw&vl=en) comparing Contax Zeiss to Zeiss Super Speeds. [Mark Holtze](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJWl59qSh7ir80BZwzSZpPw) has a [popular video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozHheBkS6LQ) on the Contax Zeiss lenses. And finally, over on [Red User](http://www.reduser.net/forum/forum.php), [Nick Morrison](http://www.smallgiant.tv/team) has an amazing ["Survival Guide"](http://www.reduser.net/forum/showthread.php?92044-Contax-Zeiss-Survival-Guide) going into great depth on each of the lenses.

## The Contax Zeiss Taxonomy 

Leveraging on an amazing resource over at [Apotelyt](https://www.apotelyt.com/camera-kit/zeiss-contax-catalog) by Peter Walkenhorst, I was able to taxonomise the full range of Contax Zeiss prime lenses and put them into a nice table.
