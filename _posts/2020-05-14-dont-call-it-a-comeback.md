After a long break in blogging, I am making a come back. I have spent alot of my newly found Covid-19 free-time finishing off my blog migration from [Ghost](https://ghost.org) to [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com); and otherwise updating and fixing my website from being a [very very boring](https://web.archive.org/web/20180831040610/https://jden.me/) single page website to something that actually represents me on the web.

In the coming blog posts I will post about various technical points of interest I came across building this website. Additonally, I will be slowly introducing various categories, verticals, columns to write about a broad variety of subjects. In the interium to avoid missing out any of my *frequently updated* blog posts you can subscribe to my newsletter below.
