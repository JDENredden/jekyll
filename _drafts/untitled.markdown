## Theorem Numbering 

We move on now to numbering theorems and the like. We employ a very similar approach however we run into much more complexness as we need to account for 4 cases:

* Numbered
* Un-numbered
* Numbered with Name
* Un-numbered with Name

Important theorems, lemmas, and definitions will have a name such as "Picard's Theorem" while others are just "Theorem 1.2".
