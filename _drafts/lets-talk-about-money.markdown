title: Lets talk about money
---

It is the dirty side of show business, the money. Fringe is expensive, last year we barely broke even and if we had to pay ourselves we would've been a loss. With everything wrapping up this year the shows were a financial successâ€”just.

The production team this year was much smaller, only myself and a stage manager were at every show (for *SUPERHUMAN*). The creative team was slightly larger but we have very limited time together. The actual cost of production for the shows themselves was not very expensive, many of the effects I do in *SUPERHUMAN* are original, so their expense is only as much as raw materials. In *Expert* I only had to buy playing cards and a playing card table. For both shows I bought new suits for costume.
